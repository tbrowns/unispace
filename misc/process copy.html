            You will first be asked about the goals you have for your project.
            Once we have a clear understanding of these goals, with our broad
            knowledge on item selection, we will help you pick ones best suited
            to your needs. To ensure that you get the most out of our services
            at a price that works well with you, a timeframe and budget will be
            negotiated in your attendance

            We will schedule a visit to your property so as to further discuss
            your idea and get a better understanding of the space and purpose
            you have in mind. During this visit, measurements of the space will
            be taken, also taking into account any locations of power outlets,
            door openings, hearths, skirting boards, etc.

            After completing steps 1 and 2, we will have a clear understanding
            of the space you are working with and what you want to fill it with.
            This will enable us to use the measurements we have gathered to
            create a completely accurate representation in the form of a
            high-quality render showing how everything will appear when complete
            and in place.

            Our third process allows you to make changes to the project as many
            times as necessary until you are completely pleased with how it
            appears in the renders and are certain you want to proceed with
            placing your order. After receiving your approval, we will order
            your items according to your specifications.
